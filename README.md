Functionality;

  I give myself a 3 on this section since Enigma class is working with encrypt and decrypt methods and the command line interface is working, but I did not attempt the crack.

Object Oriented Program;

  I also give myself a 3 on this section since I believe my program is broken into logical components and all aspect are appropriately encapsulated. That being said, I did not implement a module or inheritance.

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics

  This is a tough one but I am goin to give myself a 2.5. I am very confident that my code follows all conventions and is properly organized, but I do not have a hash anywhere and I do have two methods that are longer than 10 lines. That being said, I believe a two is a little low, based off how a 2 is defined; I think my enumerables are advanced and the best options where used, I don't think I ever followed improper convention, and I am able to speak as to why I set it up the way I did.

Test Driven Development

  I give myself a 4 here. I wrote all tests before I wrote the code. I use a stub in one place(Date), but I also believe I used a stub in a roundabout way via the Shift test; All of my methods within the class are chained to each other, which require a key and a date. When I initialize the shift object in the test setup, I hard code in a key and date, which essentially accomplishes the same thing. Aside from that, every method is tested and I made edge cases for extra characters. Test coverage is 100%.

Version Control

  Also give myself a hard 4 here. I have over 50 commits and 9 branches and each branch only includes logical and related Functionality, and no commits contain multiple pieces of functionality. All commit messages are clear and concise.
